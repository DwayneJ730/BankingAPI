# Tuition Reimbursement Management System(TRMS)

## Project Description:
The TRMS allows users in an organization, business, or structured management system to manage employee tuition riembursements. The application allows for different 
user experiences depending on the current job title of the employee. Employees can request a tuition riembursement from a class they have completed. Employees with the
correct credentials can view these requests for the purposes of approving or denying them. Also, employees can view their pending requests. If the requests are approved,
employees will be reimbursed the appropriate amount.
